3. Make Your First HTTP API(Individual)

In the team project, you need to add a new HTTP API.
Create a new URL that returns something simple. No complex logic is required for the new method.
You can simply return a string or do something interesting. You need to verify your change by actually running it with a HTTP Client or other approaches.
If you implement an HTTP GET method, you can simply try it in your browser.
Finally, please check in your change for this new method and push it to the GitHub remote repo.
